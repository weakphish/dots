Other software that I use as a developer on a regular basis:

    - Bat
    - Delta

- Good ol' pen and paper for note-taking and to-do lists.
    - Plain markdown for longer-term notes or scratch documents

Also included is...
- A Neovim configuration based on kickstart.nvim
- A Doom Emacs config, because org-mode is cool
- a Helix config, because I think Helix is awesome (and patched once ;) )
