**Other Software:**
Other software that I use as a developer on a regular basis:
- Zellij, as a tmux alternative
- [A few Rust utilities](https://gist.github.com/sts10/daadbc2f403bdffad1b6d33aff016c0a)
    - Bat
    - Delta
    - Lsd
    - Ripgrep
- Good ol' pen and paper for note-taking and to-do lists.
    - Logseq as well for long-term notes and more complex task management.

Also included is...
- a bare `.vimrc` that enables lines and syntax, as well as a setup script for Mac systems
- A Neovim configuration based on kickstart.nvim
- A Doom Emacs config, because org-mode is cool
- a Helix config, because I think Helix is awesome (and patched once ;) )
