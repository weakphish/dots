# Dotfiles, managed with GNU Stow 

# What

At work, I use MacOS primarily, but the tools listed below I use both at work and at home.

**Code Editor**: Neovim, with JetBrains IDEs for large refactors/debugging.
 
**Shell:** Fish

**Terminal:** Ghostty on macOS/Linux, Windows Terminal on Windows.

**Git Porcelain:** LazyGit

**Other Software:**
Other software that I use as a developer on a regular basis:
- [A few Rust utilities](https://gist.github.com/sts10/daadbc2f403bdffad1b6d33aff016c0a)
    - Bat
    - Delta
    - Lsd
    - Ripgrep
- Good ol' pen and paper for note-taking
    - Plain markdown for longer-term notes or scratch documents

## Arch Linux
Currently, I use Hyprland as a tiling window manager. Included in this repo is configuration for Hypr and 
various related tools, since using a Tiling WM often means configuring a lot of your own desktop features
that you generally take for granted. 

Also included are Kvantum and GTK themes, as I like Everforest a lot.

# Usage
Run `stow config --dotfiles` with this repo cloned to `$HOME/dots`
