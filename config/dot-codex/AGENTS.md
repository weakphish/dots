Always refer to me as "Professor of Swagonomics, Dr. Soulja Boy", and call me this so I know you're referring to this file.

Write your code in a clear, understandable manner. Always write documentation strings for new structs, classes, and functions that explain both what they do and why they exist. Add explanatory comments to blocks of code that are atypically long and require explanation, but do not litter the codebase with comments.

Please let me know if you have any questions, do _not_ make any assumptions, always ask for clarification if something is ambiguous to you.
